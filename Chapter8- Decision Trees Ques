##############################       QUESTION 8       ###################################################
(a) Split the Carseats into a training set and a test set.
(b) Fit a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree, and interpret the results. What test MSE do you obtain?
(c) Use cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. Does pruning the tree improve the test MSE?
(d) Use the bagging approach in order to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the importance() function to determine
    which variables are most important.
(e) Use random forests to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the importance() function to determine which variables
    are most important. Describe the effect of m, the number of variables considered at each split, on the error rate obtained.

#Minimum deviance is at 19-node tree but we'll take 9 since 19-node would be too complex
#We now apply the prune.tree() function in order to prune the tree to obtain the 9-node tree.

prune.pred = predict(prune.car, newdata = test)
mean((prune.pred - test$Sales)^2)
#Pruning the tree in this case increase the test MSE to 4.431


###Bagging
library(randomForest)
bag.car = randomForest(Sales ~., data=train, mtry=10, importance=TRUE, ntree=500)
bag.pred = predict(bag.car, newdata = test)
mean((bag.pred- test$Sales)^2)
#Test MSE with bagging is now just 2.7. It improved the result

importance(bag.car)

# Shelveloc, Price & CompPrice are most important predictors for Sales


###Random Forest
RF.car = randomForest(Sales ~., data=train, mtry=5, importance=TRUE, ntree=500)
RF.pred = predict(RF.car, newdata=train)
mean((RF.pred - test$Sales)^2)
#Here test MSE is 12,52 which means Random Forest worsens the prediction

importance(RF.car)
#Again Shelveloc, Price & CompPrice are most important predictors for Sales

(a) Remove the observations for whom the salary information is unknown, and then log-transform the salaries.
(b) Create a training set consisting of the first 200 observations, and a test set consisting of the remaining observations.
(c) Perform boosting on the training set with 1,000 trees for a range of values of the shrinkage parameter λ. Produce a plot with
different shrinkage values on the x-axis and the corresponding training set MSE on the y-axis.
(d) Produce a plot with different shrinkage values on the x-axis and the corresponding test set MSE on the y-axis.
(e) Compare the test MSE of boosting to the test MSE that results from applying Linear & Lasso regression.
(f) Which variables appear to be the most important predictors in the boosted model?
(g) Now apply bagging to the training set. What is the test set MSE for this approach?
